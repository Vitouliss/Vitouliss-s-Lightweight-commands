Awwwww yeaaaah me lightweight commands I randomly was working on to replace my other bloated and crappy one. 

## Current Commands

mes/TEST = Broadcasts a message to the whole server with your name and the message (Might want to remove this command due to the fact that Message is kind of deprecated)

tp/USERNAME = Teleports you to that username...Does not have to be the whole username.

tph/USERNAME = Teleports a player to you..Does not have to be the whole username.

## To do:

(**COMPLETED**) Ability to set multiple homes

(*NOT DONE*) Make sure when someone set's a home such as "lol" make sure they can't set "lol" again 
unless they remove it.

(*NOT DONE*) Add a command that supports multiple arguments (Gotta slap myself to stop being a wimp)

(**COMPLETED BUT BUGGY**) Make setjump less hard to work with.

(**COMPLETED**) Wrap the clean command in a protected function.

(**COMPLETED**) Make a command like clean/ however it searches thing everything in game. (It has not been tested though)

(*NOT DONE!*) Make like a "player was last seen" thingy.
