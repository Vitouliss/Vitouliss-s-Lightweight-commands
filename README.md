## Vitouliss's Lightweight Commands! 

Awwwww yeaaaah me lightweight commands I randomly was working on to replace my other bloated and crappy one. 

## Current Commands

mes/TEST = Broadcasts a message to the whole server with your name and the message (Might want to remove this command due to the fact that Message is kind of deprecated)

tp/USERNAME = Teleports you to that username...Does not have to be the whole username.

tph/USERNAME = Teleports a player to you..Does not have to be the whole username.

tpp/Coords = Teleports you to the specifiy coords (Currently crappy...Use it under your own risk)

kill/USERNAME = Kills a player.

sethome/NAME = Set's your home with a name (For multiple homes)

home/NAME = Go to the home you set. If you don't have one...It doesn't matter.

delhome/NAME = Delete the home's with the name you specify. 

heal/USERNAME = Heals the current player to MaxHealth. 

charid/NUMBER = Changes your characters to that of another person's id and then reset's your character.

speed/NUMBER = Changes your WalkSpeed!

explode/USERNAME = Blows up a player!!! NO CREEPER CHAOS!

setjump/yvelocity = Makes you set your jump speed. Currently hard to work with. 

listcommands = Lists all the available commands (Might miss some...)

gc/USERNAME = Parents the player's character to nil (Amazing)

respawn/USERNAME = Parent's the player's character back to Workspace (Useful to put the person out of gc/)

clean/CLASSNAME = Clears everything in the workspace with the ClassName you specify.

## To do:

(**COMPLETED**) Ability to set multiple homes

(**COMPLETED BUT BUGGY**) Make setjump less hard to work with.

(**COMPLETED**) Wrap the clean command in a protected function.

(*Eh close*) MAKE THE CODE LESS BUGGY!!!
